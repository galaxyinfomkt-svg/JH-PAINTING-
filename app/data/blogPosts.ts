# Best Exterior Paint Colors for Massachusetts Homes in 2025

Choosing the right exterior paint color for your Massachusetts home isn't just about aesthetics—it's about creating a lasting impression while protecting your investment from our challenging New England weather.

## Top Trending Colors for 2025

**Sherwin-Williams match:** Fireweed SW 6328

## Weather Considerations for Massachusetts

Massachusetts experiences all four seasons intensely, which means your exterior paint must withstand:

- **Harsh winters** with snow, ice, and freeze-thaw cycles
- **Humid summers** that can promote mold and mildew
- **Salt air** (especially on the coast from Cape Cod to Gloucester)
- **UV exposure** that can cause fading

### Our Professional Recommendation

At JH Painting Services, we exclusively use premium paints from Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore because they offer:

- Superior adhesion and durability
- Excellent UV protection
- Mold and mildew resistance
- Color retention for 10+ years
- Warranties that back up their claims

## How to Choose Your Color

1. **Consider your home's architecture** - Traditional styles look best with classic colors
2. **Look at your neighborhood** - You want to stand out tastefully, not clash
3. **Test samples** - Always paint large swatches and view them at different times of day
4. **Think about your landscape** - Colors should complement your yard and gardens
5. **Factor in your roof color** - Your paint should work with existing elements

# How Much Does Interior Painting Cost in Massachusetts? 2025 Price Guide

One of the most common questions we receive at JH Painting Services is "How much will it cost to paint my interior?" This comprehensive guide breaks down everything you need to know about interior painting costs in Massachusetts for 2025.

## Average Interior Painting Costs in Massachusetts

| Project Type | Price Range | Average Cost |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Single Room | $300 - $800 | $500 |
| Per Square Foot | $2 - $6 | $3.50 |
| Full Interior (2,000 sq ft) | $4,000 - $8,000 | $6,000 |
| Full Interior (3,000 sq ft) | $6,000 - $12,000 | $9,000 |

## Factors That Affect Interior Painting Costs

### 1. Square Footage
The most obvious factor—larger spaces require more paint and labor. Our pricing is transparent and based on actual measurements.

### 2. Ceiling Height
Standard 8-foot ceilings are one thing, but Boston's historic homes often feature 10-12 foot ceilings, which require additional equipment and time.

### 3. Prep Work Required
- **Minimal prep:** Clean walls, minor touch-ups ($2-3/sq ft)
- **Moderate prep:** Patching holes, sanding, priming ($3-4/sq ft)
- **Extensive prep:** Wallpaper removal, major repairs, textured walls ($4-6/sq ft)

### 4. Paint Quality
We only use premium paints, but there are different levels:
- **Good (Duration, Regal Select):** Excellent coverage, durability
- **Better (Emerald, Aura):** Superior washability, color retention
- **Best (Designer collections):** Ultimate performance, unique finishes

### 5. Number of Colors
Multiple colors require more cutting-in time and careful taping:
- Single color throughout: Standard pricing
- 2-3 colors: 10-15% increase
- 4+ colors or accent walls: 20-30% increase

### 6. Trim and Doors
Painting trim, baseboards, crown molding, and doors adds significant value but also cost:
- Trim only: Add $1-2/linear foot
- Doors: $50-150 per door
- Full trim package: Add 30-50% to base price

## Regional Price Variations in Massachusetts

Different areas of Massachusetts have different costs of living, which affects painting prices:

| Region | Price Range/sq ft |
|--------|-------------------|
| Greater Boston | $3.50 - $6 |
| North Shore | $3 - $5.50 |
| South Shore | $3 - $5 |
| MetroWest | $3.25 - $5.50 |
| Central MA | $2.50 - $4.50 |
| Western MA | $2 - $4 |

## How to Get the Best Value

### 1. Bundle Projects
Painting your entire home at once is more cost-effective than room by room. You'll save on setup time and mobilization costs.

### 2. Be Flexible with Timing
Winter months (December-February) are often slower, and some contractors offer discounts.

### 3. Do Some Prep Yourself
Moving furniture and removing wall décor before the crew arrives saves labor time.

### 4. Choose Quality Over Cheap
A $2,000 paint job using cheap materials might need redoing in 3 years. A $4,000 job with premium paint can last 10+ years.

# Cabinet Painting vs Replacement: The Smart Choice for Massachusetts Homeowners

Your kitchen cabinets are one of the most impactful elements of your home. When they start looking dated, you have two main options: paint them or replace them entirely. Here's everything you need to know to make the right decision.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

| Factor | Cabinet Painting | Cabinet Replacement |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Average Cost | $3,000 - $7,000 | $15,000 - $50,000 |
| Timeline | 3-5 days | 4-8 weeks |
| Disruption | Minimal | Major |
| ROI | 75-100% | 50-75% |
| Waste | None | Significant |

## When Cabinet Painting is the Right Choice

### Your Cabinets Are Structurally Sound
If your cabinet boxes, doors, and hinges are in good condition, painting is an excellent option. Even if they're dated oak or have worn finishes, professional painting can transform them.

### You Like Your Current Layout
Happy with how your kitchen flows? Painting lets you update the look without changing what works.

### Budget Considerations
With cabinet painting costing 70-80% less than replacement, you can achieve a stunning transformation and have budget left for other upgrades like new hardware, lighting, or countertops.

### Timeline Matters
Painting can be completed in days, not weeks. Your kitchen remains functional throughout most of the process.

### Environmental Impact
Keeping your existing cabinets out of the landfill is the sustainable choice.

## When Replacement Makes More Sense

### Structural Issues
Water damage, warping, or broken cabinet boxes often can't be repaired cost-effectively.

### Major Layout Changes
If you're relocating appliances, adding an island, or completely reconfiguring your kitchen, new cabinets make sense.

### Severe Style Mismatches
Some cabinet styles (like dated Mediterranean or overly ornate designs) may not translate well to modern aesthetics even with paint.

## Our Professional Cabinet Painting Process

At JH Painting Services, we follow a meticulous process that ensures professional, lasting results:

### 1. Assessment & Prep
- Remove all doors, drawers, and hardware
- Label everything for perfect reassembly
- Clean and degrease all surfaces
- Sand for proper adhesion
- Fill any imperfections

### 2. Prime
- Apply bonding primer specifically designed for cabinets
- This step is crucial for durability and prevents peeling

### 3. Paint Application
- Spray apply for a smooth, factory-like finish
- Multiple thin coats for best results
- Cure time between coats for maximum hardness

### 4. Reinstallation
- New hardware installation available
- Proper alignment of all doors and drawers
- Final inspection and touch-ups

## Popular Cabinet Colors in Massachusetts

Based on our recent projects across Greater Boston and MetroWest:

1. **White/Off-White** - 45% of projects (timeless, brightens any kitchen)
2. **Navy Blue** - 20% (sophisticated, pairs with brass hardware)
3. **Sage Green** - 15% (on-trend, nature-inspired)
4. **Gray Tones** - 12% (modern, versatile)
5. **Black** - 8% (dramatic, high-contrast look)

## Real Results: Before & After

We've transformed hundreds of kitchens across Massachusetts, from dated oak cabinets in Worcester to worn white cabinets in Brookline. Our portfolio speaks for itself.

## The JH Painting Advantage

- **Premium Materials:** We use Sherwin-Williams ProClassic or Benjamin Moore Advance—paints specifically engineered for cabinets
- **Professional Finish:** Spray application for a smooth, factory-quality look
- **Hardware Upgrade:** We can install new hinges, pulls, and knobs
- **Warranty:** 2-year workmanship warranty on all cabinet painting

# How to Prepare Your Home for Exterior Painting: Complete Checklist

Proper preparation is the foundation of a successful exterior painting project. At JH Painting Services, we handle all prep work, but understanding the process helps you know what to expect and how to prepare your property.

## Before the Crew Arrives

### 1. Clear the Perimeter

- Relocate potted plants and garden décor

- Trim bushes and shrubs 12+ inches from the house

### 3. Vehicle Arrangements

- Note that overspray can travel—keep vehicles at least 20 feet away

### Power Washing (Day 1)
We thoroughly clean all surfaces to remove:
- Dirt and grime

### Masking & Protection

| Dry Time | Days 2-3 | Allow surfaces to dry completely |
| Prep Work | Days 4-5 | Scrape, sand, caulk, prime, repair |

# How Long Does Exterior Paint Last in Massachusetts?

Massachusetts presents unique challenges for exterior paint. Our combination of freezing winters, humid summers, and coastal conditions can take a toll on even quality paint jobs. Here's what you need to know about exterior paint longevity in the Bay State.

## Average Lifespan by Surface Type

| Surface | Average Lifespan | With Premium Paint |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Wood Siding | 5-7 years | 7-10 years |
| Aluminum Siding | 5-8 years | 8-12 years |
| Vinyl Siding | 10-15 years | 15-20 years |
| Stucco | 5-6 years | 7-10 years |
| Brick | 15-20 years | 20-25 years |
| Wood Trim | 3-5 years | 5-7 years |

## Massachusetts Weather Factors

### Winter Challenges
- **Freeze-thaw cycles:** Water penetrates paint film, freezes, and causes cracking
- **Ice dams:** Prolonged ice contact can damage paint near rooflines
- **Snow accumulation:** Moisture sits against surfaces for extended periods
- **Salt exposure:** Road salt and deicing chemicals damage paint near ground level

### Summer Challenges
- **UV exposure:** Direct sun causes fading and chalking
- **Humidity:** High moisture promotes mildew growth
- **Temperature swings:** Paint expands and contracts, causing cracking

### Coastal Considerations
If you live on Cape Cod, the North Shore, or South Shore, salt air adds additional stress:
- Accelerated fading
- Increased rust on metal components
- More frequent cleaning needed
- Consider specialized coastal formulations

## Signs Your Exterior Needs Repainting

### Early Warning Signs (Address Soon)
- Fading or color inconsistency
- Chalking (powdery residue when touched)
- Minor cracks in paint film
- Mildew spots (greenish-black staining)

### Urgent Signs (Paint ASAP)
- Peeling or flaking paint
- Exposed bare wood
- Rotting or soft wood
- Large cracks showing substrate
- Bubbling or blistering

## How to Maximize Paint Lifespan

### 1. Proper Preparation
The most important factor in paint longevity is prep work:
- Complete removal of loose paint
- Proper sanding and smoothing
- Quality primer on bare surfaces
- Caulking all gaps and cracks

### 2. Premium Paint Selection
We use Sherwin-Williams Duration for a reason:
- Advanced resin technology
- Superior moisture resistance
- Excellent flexibility (handles expansion/contraction)
- Built-in mildew resistance

### 3. Correct Application
Professional application matters:
- Proper dry time between coats
- Correct temperature and humidity during application
- Two full coats minimum
- Attention to detail on edges and trim

### 4. Regular Maintenance
Simple steps to extend paint life:
- Annual power washing (gentle pressure)
- Trim bushes away from siding
- Clean gutters to prevent overflow staining
- Address mildew spots promptly
- Touch up chips before they spread

## Regional Variations in Massachusetts

Different areas face different challenges:

**Greater Boston/Urban Areas**
- Air pollution can accelerate deterioration
- Less sun exposure (buildings block light) can mean more mildew
- **Expected lifespan:** 6-8 years with quality paint

**North Shore/Cape Ann**
- Salt spray is a major factor
- Wind-driven rain tests paint adhesion
- **Expected lifespan:** 5-7 years (coastal-formula paints recommended)

**Western Massachusetts**
- More extreme temperature variations
- Heavy snow loads
- **Expected lifespan:** 6-9 years

**Cape Cod/Islands**
- Intense salt exposure
- High humidity
- Strong UV exposure
- **Expected lifespan:** 5-7 years (frequent touch-ups recommended)

## Cost of Waiting Too Long

Delaying repainting can cost significantly more:

| Condition | Additional Prep Needed | Extra Cost |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| Minor fading | Standard prep | $0 |
| Peeling paint | Extensive scraping | +15-25% |
| Bare wood exposed | Wood treatment, primer | +25-40% |
| Wood rot present | Carpentry repairs | +40-100% |

1. **Thorough inspection** to identify all issues
2. **Complete power washing** to remove contaminants
3. **Expert prep work** including repairs and priming

# Interior Paint Colors That Help Sell Homes in Massachusetts

If you're preparing to sell your home, the right paint colors can significantly impact buyer perception and your final sale price. Here's what real estate experts and our experience tell us about colors that sell in Massachusetts.

## The Psychology of Selling with Color

Buyers make snap judgments within seconds of entering a home. The right colors:
- Make spaces feel larger and brighter
- Help buyers envision themselves living there
- Create an emotional connection
- Signal that the home is well-maintained

## Top Selling Colors for 2025

### 1. Agreeable Gray (Sherwin-Williams SW 7029)
**Best for:** Living rooms, hallways, open floor plans

The #1 selling paint color in America works beautifully in Massachusetts homes. This warm gray has enough warmth to feel inviting without being too specific.

### 2. White Dove (Benjamin Moore OC-17)
**Best for:** Bedrooms, bathrooms, trim

A soft, warm white that doesn't feel stark or clinical. It photographs beautifully and appeals to virtually everyone.

### 3. Pale Oak (Benjamin Moore OC-20)
**Best for:** Open concept spaces, modern homes

A sophisticated greige that works with both warm and cool furnishings. Very popular in contemporary Massachusetts homes.

### 4. Repose Gray (Sherwin-Williams SW 7015)
**Best for:** Entire home, especially two-story foyers

A true neutral gray that creates continuity throughout the home. Works in any lighting condition.

### 5. Edgecomb Gray (Benjamin Moore HC-173)
**Best for:** Colonial homes, traditional architecture

A warm, taupe-gray that complements the millwork common in Massachusetts historic homes.

## Colors to Avoid When Selling

### Bold Feature Walls
That navy accent wall you love? Buyers might see it as a project they'll need to tackle.

### Bright/Saturated Colors
Hot pink, bright orange, or lime green will turn off most buyers.

### Very Dark Colors
Charcoal rooms photograph poorly and make spaces feel smaller.

### Dated Colors
Certain colors scream "needs updating":
- Terra cotta
- Hunter green
- Burgundy
- Mauve

## Room-by-Room Recommendations

### Entryway/Foyer
Create a welcoming first impression:
- Light, warm neutrals
- Clean and bright
- Sets tone for the whole house

**Our pick:** Benjamin Moore White Dove

### Living Room
Where buyers spend the most time visualizing:
- Warm, inviting neutrals
- Good in both natural and artificial light
- Coordinates with multiple décor styles

**Our pick:** Sherwin-Williams Agreeable Gray

### Kitchen
Clean and fresh sells:
- White or off-white walls
- Neutral cabinet colors
- Avoid dated oak—consider cabinet painting!

**Our pick:** Benjamin Moore Chantilly Lace (walls), Advance White Dove (cabinets)

### Primary Bedroom
Calming and serene:
- Soft, muted tones
- Avoid gendered colors
- Create a retreat feeling

**Our pick:** Benjamin Moore Pale Oak

### Bathrooms
Spa-like and clean:
- White or very light colors
- Avoid bold tiles
- Crisp and fresh feeling

**Our pick:** Sherwin-Williams Pure White

### Children's Rooms
Neutral over themed:
- Skip the princesses and trucks
- Light, gender-neutral colors
- Let buyers reimagine the space

**Our pick:** Sherwin-Williams Accessible Beige

## The Staging Advantage

Fresh paint combined with proper staging can yield significant returns:

| Investment | Typical ROI |
|------------|-------------|
| Interior Paint | 100-200% |
| Paint + Staging | 200-400% |
| Paint + Staging + Minor Updates | 300-500% |

*Based on Massachusetts real estate data, 2024*

## Massachusetts Market Insights

Different areas have different buyer preferences:

**Boston/Cambridge**
Buyers expect move-in ready with modern neutrals. Clean whites and sophisticated grays perform best.

**North Shore**
Traditional buyers appreciate classic palettes. Warm whites and gentle taupes appeal to families.

**MetroWest**
Mix of traditional and contemporary buyers. Agreeable Gray-type neutrals work universally.

**South Shore**
Coastal influences mean lighter palettes. Soft whites and gentle grays photograph well.

# DIY vs Professional Painting: When Should You Hire a Pro?

We get it—YouTube makes everything look easy, and you might be tempted to tackle that painting project yourself. Here's an honest assessment of when DIY makes sense and when calling professionals is the smarter choice.

## When DIY Painting Works

### Good DIY Projects

**Single Small Room**
A bedroom or home office with standard ceilings and minimal prep work is manageable for most homeowners.

**Touch-Ups**
Small areas, nail holes, and minor scuffs are perfect DIY territory.

**Accent Walls**
A single wall in good condition? Totally doable with some patience.

**Furniture Pieces**
Small items like shelves, chairs, or side tables.

### DIY Checklist
Before starting, honestly assess:
- [ ] Do you have a full weekend (or more) available?
- [ ] Are you comfortable on a ladder?
- [ ] Is the existing paint in good condition?
- [ ] Are ceilings standard height (8-9 feet)?
- [ ] No repairs needed (holes, cracks, water damage)?
- [ ] Single color, simple room?

If you checked all boxes, DIY might work for you.

## When to Call Professionals

### Always Hire a Pro For:

**Exterior Painting**
- Heights require proper equipment and safety training
- Prep work is extensive and critical
- Weather timing is crucial
- Mistakes are very costly to fix
- Professional finish makes a huge curb appeal difference

**High Ceilings/Two-Story Foyers**
- Safety concerns with tall ladders/scaffolding
- Difficult to maintain consistent coverage
- Professional equipment needed

**Entire House Interiors**
- Time investment is substantial (weeks, not days)
- Consistency across rooms requires experience
- Furniture moving and protection is labor-intensive
- You'll want to actually live in your home during the project

**Cabinet Painting**
- Requires spray equipment for professional finish
- Extensive prep work (cleaning, sanding, priming)
- Poor DIY results are very visible
- Often costs more to fix DIY mistakes than to hire pro initially

**Lead Paint (Pre-1978 Homes)**
- Health hazard requires certified professionals
- Legal requirements for proper handling
- Not worth the risk

**Textured Ceilings/Walls**
- Matching texture requires experience
- Special techniques and equipment needed

**Time-Sensitive Projects**
- Selling your home? Hire pros for best results
- Holiday deadline? Don't stress yourself out

## The True Cost Comparison

### DIY Costs (Living Room Example)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Paint (2 gallons premium) | $150 |
| Primer | $40 |
| Brushes, rollers, trays | $50 |
| Painter's tape | $30 |
| Drop cloths | $25 |
| Ladder (if needed) | $100+ |
| Sandpaper, spackle | $20 |
| **Total Materials** | **$415+** |
| Your Time (15-20 hours) | ??? |

### Professional Cost (Same Room)
$400-$800 including materials, labor, and cleanup

### The Hidden Costs of DIY
- Time away from work, family, hobbies
- Potential for mistakes requiring correction
- Inferior finish affecting home value
- Physical strain (especially ceilings)
- Cleanup and disposal hassles
- Tools you'll use once and store forever

## Quality Differences

### DIY Common Issues
- Visible brush strokes and roller marks
- Uneven coverage
- Paint on trim, windows, ceilings
- Missed spots
- Drips and runs
- Cutting-in wobbles
- Inconsistent sheen

### Professional Results
- Smooth, factory-like finish
- Clean, crisp lines
- Even coverage throughout
- Proper prep ensures adhesion
- Protected surfaces (floors, furniture)
- Daily cleanup
- Warranty on workmanship

## Hybrid Approach: Save Money Smartly

If budget is a concern, consider this approach:

### Do Yourself:
- Clear the room of furniture
- Remove outlet covers and switch plates
- Take down curtains and wall décor
- Clean walls (dust, cobwebs)
- Fill small nail holes with spackle

### Leave to Pros:
- All actual painting
- Taping and masking
- Major repairs
- Ceiling painting
- Trim and baseboards

This can save 10-15% on your quote while ensuring professional results.

## Questions to Ask Before DIY

1. **How much is your time worth?** If you earn $30/hour and the project takes 20 hours, that's $600 of your time.

2. **What's your quality expectation?** Are you okay with "good enough" or do you want showroom quality?

3. **How long will you live here?** If you're selling soon, professional painting provides better ROI.

4. **Do you actually enjoy painting?** Some people find it therapeutic; others find it miserable.

5. **What's your backup plan?** If it goes wrong, what will you do?

## Our Honest Recommendation

For most Massachusetts homeowners:

- **DIY:** Small touch-ups, single accent walls, small craft projects
- **Hire Pro:** Multiple rooms, any exterior, cabinets, whole-house projects, homes being sold

# Hardwood Floor Refinishing: Complete Massachusetts Homeowner Guide

Massachusetts is home to countless historic properties with beautiful original hardwood floors. Whether you have century-old pine floors in a Beacon Hill brownstone or oak floors in a MetroWest colonial, proper refinishing can restore them to their original glory.

## Signs Your Floors Need Refinishing

### It's Time When You See:
- Visible scratches that catch your attention
- Dull, worn traffic patterns
- Gray or dark discoloration
- Water stains or damage marks
- Finish wearing through to bare wood
- Gaps between boards (may need more than refinishing)

### Not Quite Ready Yet:
- Minor surface scratches (may just need a buff and recoat)
- Overall dullness (professional cleaning might help)
- One or two small stains (spot repair possible)

## The Refinishing Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
- Clear all furniture and items from rooms
- Remove shoe moldings/baseboards (optional but recommended)
- Inspect for protruding nails and set them
- Cover doorways with plastic sheeting
- Seal HVAC vents

### Phase 2: Sanding
**Multiple passes with progressively finer grits:**
1. Coarse (36-40 grit): Removes old finish and levels surface
2. Medium (60-80 grit): Removes sanding scratches
3. Fine (100-120 grit): Prepares surface for stain/finish
4. Edge sanding: Reaches areas drum sander can't

### Phase 3: Staining (Optional)
- Fill grain if desired (especially for oak)
- Apply stain evenly
- Allow proper dry time (24-48 hours typically)
- Buff between coats if multiple applications

### Phase 4: Finishing
**Multiple coats applied:**
- First coat: Seals the wood
- Light sanding between coats ("screen and recoat")
- Second coat: Builds protection
- Third coat (optional): Maximum durability

### Phase 5: Curing
- Walk-on ready: 24-48 hours
- Light furniture: 3-5 days
- Heavy furniture: 7-14 days
- Area rugs: 30 days (prevents finish softening)

## Types of Finishes

### Oil-Based Polyurethane
**Pros:**
- Warm amber tone
- Self-leveling
- Time-proven durability

**Cons:**
- Strong odor during application
- Longer dry time (24+ hours between coats)
- Yellows more over time

### Water-Based Polyurethane
**Pros:**
- Low odor, low VOC
- Fast dry time (2-4 hours between coats)
- Crystal clear finish
- Doesn't yellow

**Cons:**
- May raise grain (requires additional sanding)
- Some feel it's not as durable
- Can look "plastic" if not applied properly

### Hardwax Oil
**Pros:**
- Natural, matte appearance
- Easy spot repairs
- Eco-friendly
- Enhances wood grain

**Cons:**
- Requires more maintenance
- Less scratch resistance
- Higher initial cost

### Our Recommendation
For most Massachusetts homes, we recommend:
- **High-traffic areas:** Water-based polyurethane (Bona Traffic HD)
- **Historic homes:** Oil-based for authentic patina
- **Modern aesthetics:** Water-based for clarity

## Popular Stain Colors

### Classic Choices
1. **Natural** - No stain, just clear finish
2. **Golden Oak** - Traditional, warm tone
3. **English Chestnut** - Medium brown, very popular
4. **Provincial** - Warm medium brown
5. **Jacobean** - Rich, dark brown

### Trending in Massachusetts
- **Weathered Oak** - Gray undertones, modern feel
- **Ebony** - Dark, contemporary statement
- **White Oak Natural** - Light, Scandinavian inspired
- **Special Walnut** - Sophisticated medium-dark

## Cost Factors

### Per Square Foot Pricing

| Service | Price Range |
|---------|-------------|
| Basic Refinish (sand + 2 coats) | $3-5/sq ft |
| Full Refinish (sand + stain + 3 coats) | $4-7/sq ft |
| Buff and Recoat | $1.50-2.50/sq ft |
| Repair + Refinish | $5-10/sq ft |

### Project Examples (Massachusetts Averages)

| Home Size | Basic | With Stain |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| 500 sq ft | $1,500-2,500 | $2,000-3,500 |
| 1,000 sq ft | $3,000-5,000 | $4,000-7,000 |
| 2,000 sq ft | $6,000-10,000 | $8,000-14,000 |

## Timeline Expectations

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Preparation | 1 day |
| Sanding | 1-2 days |
| Staining (if applicable) | 1 day + 24hr dry |
| Finishing | 2-3 days |
| Curing before furniture | 3-7 days |
| **Total Project** | **7-14 days** |

## Living Arrangements During Refinishing

The refinishing process requires you to vacate the work areas due to:
- Dust during sanding (despite dust collection)
- Strong fumes (especially oil-based products)
- Need for undisturbed curing

### Options:
- Stay with family/friends
- Finish in phases (room by room)
- Short-term rental
- Time project during a planned trip

## Questions to Ask Your Contractor

1. What type of finish do you recommend and why?
2. How many coats will be applied?
3. What sanding equipment do you use?
4. Do you have dust containment systems?
5. What's your timeline including cure time?
6. Can I see examples of similar work?
7. What warranty do you offer?

## When Floors Can't Be Refinished

Sometimes floors are beyond refinishing:
- Sanded too many times (no wood left above tongue)
- Severe water damage with warping
- Termite or pest damage
- Extremely wide gaps (structural issue)
- Engineered wood (limited refinishes possible)

In these cases, replacement may be more cost-effective.
